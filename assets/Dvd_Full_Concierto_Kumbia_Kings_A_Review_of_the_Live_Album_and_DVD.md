Kumbia Kings was formed in 1999 by A.B. Quintanilla and Cruz Martinez, who wanted to create a new sound that would appeal to both the Latino and the mainstream markets. They recruited singers Frankie J, DJ Kane, and Pee Wee, as well as other musicians and dancers, to form the group. They released their debut album *Amor, Familia y Respeto* in 1999, which was a commercial and critical success. The album sold over 500,000 copies and earned them a Grammy nomination for Best Latin Rock/Alternative Album.
  
The group continued to release more albums and singles, such as *Shhh!*, *4*, *Fuego*, and *Los Remixes 2.0*, which featured collaborations with artists like Juan Gabriel, Ozomatli, El Gran Silencio, and Juanes. They also toured extensively in the United States, Mexico, Latin America, and Europe, performing at venues like Madison Square Garden, Staples Center, and Estadio Azteca. They won several awards and accolades, such as Premios Lo Nuestro, Billboard Latin Music Awards, and MTV Video Music Awards Latin America.
  
However, in 2006, the group faced some internal conflicts and legal disputes that led to their split. A.B. Quintanilla left the group and formed Kumbia All Starz, while Cruz Martinez retained the name Kumbia Kings and continued with some of the original members. Both groups claimed to be the legitimate successors of Kumbia Kings and released competing albums and singles. The fans were divided and confused by the situation, which affected the popularity and sales of both groups.
