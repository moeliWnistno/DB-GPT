In this article, we will show you how to use Ozeki VoIP SIP SDK 9 2 0 13 to develop a simple VoIP application that can make and receive calls. We will use Visual Studio as our IDE and NuGet as our package manager.
 
## Step 1: Install Ozeki VoIP SIP SDK from NuGet
 
The easiest way to install Ozeki VoIP SIP SDK is to use NuGet, which is a package manager for .NET projects. To install Ozeki VoIP SIP SDK from NuGet, follow these steps:
 
- Open Visual Studio and create a new C# console application project.
- Go to Tools > NuGet Package Manager > Package Manager Console.
- Type the following command in the console and press Enter: `Install-Package ozeki.voip.sip.client`
- Wait for the installation to complete. You should see a message saying "Successfully installed 'ozeki.voip.sip.client'."

Alternatively, you can also install Ozeki VoIP SIP SDK from the NuGet Package Manager GUI. To do that, follow these steps:

- Open Visual Studio and create a new C# console application project.
- Go to Tools > NuGet Package Manager > Manage NuGet Packages for Solution.
- Click on the Browse tab and search for "ozeki.voip.sip.client".
- Select the package and click on Install.
- Accept the license agreement and wait for the installation to complete.

## Step 2: Create a SIP account
 
To make and receive calls using Ozeki VoIP SIP SDK, you need a SIP account that can register to a SIP server or a PBX system. You can use any SIP provider or PBX system that supports standard SIP protocol. For example, you can use Ozeki Phone System XE, which is a powerful PBX system that works well with Ozeki VoIP SIP SDK.
 
To create a SIP account, you need to provide some information, such as your username, password, domain name, display name, etc. You can get these information from your SIP provider or PBX system administrator. For example, if you use Ozeki Phone System XE, you can create a SIP account by following these steps:

- Open Ozeki Phone System XE web interface and log in with your admin credentials.
- Go to Extensions > Add new extension > Standard extension.
- Fill in the required fields, such as Extension number (e.g., 1001), Display name (e.g., John), Password (e.g., 1234), etc.
- Click on OK to save the changes.

Now you have a SIP account that you can use with Ozeki VoIP SIP SDK.
 
## Step 3: Write the code
 
Now that you have installed Ozeki VoIP SIP SDK and created a SIP account, you can write the code for your VoIP application. The code will consist of three main parts:

- A class that handles the call events and operations.
- A class that tests the call functionality.
- A main method that creates an instance of the test class and runs it.

  `

// A class that handles the call events and operations
public class CallHandlerSample
{
    // A field that stores the softphone object
    private IS 0f148eb4a0


`
