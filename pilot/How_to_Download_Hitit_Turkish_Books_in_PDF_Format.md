How can you make the most of Hitit books? Here are some tips to help you use Hitit books effectively and efficiently:

- Before you start a lesson, review the previous lessons and check your understanding. You can use the workbook or the online exercises to practice what you have learned.
- While you read or listen to a text or a dialogue, try to guess the meaning of new words from the context. You can also use a dictionary or an online translator to look up unfamiliar words. Write down the words and their definitions in a notebook or a flashcard app.
- After you finish a lesson, try to summarize the main points and grammar rules in your own words. You can also write or record a short summary in Turkish and check it with the answer key or a native speaker.
- Use the audio files to improve your listening and speaking skills. You can listen to them as many times as you want and repeat after the speakers. You can also record yourself and compare your pronunciation and intonation with the original.
