A web file manager is a web application that allows you to browse, upload, download, and manage files on a remote server using a web browser. It is similar to an FTP client, but with a more user-friendly and graphical interface. A web file manager can be useful for accessing your files when you are away from your home network, or when you don't have an FTP client installed on your device.
