The software supports R-J, R-J2, R-J3, R-30iA and R-30iB controllers. It can also handle KAREL programs and system variables. The software has a simple interface that lets users select the source and destination files and folders, and choose the conversion options. The software can also perform batch conversions of multiple files.
 
R-J ASCII Program Translator is available for download from the FANUC website or from third-party sources. The latest version is 9.5[^1^] [^2^], which was released in July 2020. The software requires Windows XP or higher to run.
 
R-J ASCII Program Translator is a handy tool for FANUC robot users who need to work with different formats of robot programs. It can save time and effort by automating the conversion process and ensuring compatibility between different controllers.

## FANUC Robots: A Leader in Industrial Automation
 
FANUC is one of the world's leading manufacturers of industrial robots, with over 600,000 units installed in more than 100 countries. FANUC robots are used for a variety of applications, such as welding, painting, assembly, pick and place, material handling, machine tending, and dispensing.
 
FANUC robots are known for their high performance, reliability, and ease of use. They can be programmed using a teach pendant, a graphical user interface, or a PC-based software. FANUC also offers a range of smart options and accessories, such as vision systems, force sensors, simulation software, and controllers.
 
FANUC robots are designed to meet the needs of different industries and applications. They can handle payloads from 4 kg to 2.3 tons, and have reaches from 280 mm to 4.7 m. They can also operate in harsh environments, such as high temperatures, dust, or water. FANUC robots are compatible with various communication protocols and standards, such as Ethernet/IP, DeviceNet, Profibus, and OPC UA.
 
## FANUC Robots: A History of Innovation and Excellence
 
FANUC has a long history of innovation and excellence in the field of robotics. The company was founded in 1956 as a subsidiary of Fujitsu Limited, and started developing numerical control (NC) systems for machine tools. In 1974, FANUC introduced its first industrial robot, the FANUC LRMate 200iD/7L.
 
Since then, FANUC has developed many groundbreaking products and technologies, such as the first electric servo-driven robot in 1976, the first robot with a built-in vision system in 1983, the first collaborative robot in 2015, and the first robot with artificial intelligence capabilities in 2018.
 
FANUC has also expanded its global presence and market share through strategic partnerships and acquisitions. In 1982, FANUC formed a joint venture with General Motors Corporation (GM) to create GMFanuc Robotics Corporation, which later became FANUC Robotics America Corporation. In 1992, FANUC acquired the German robot manufacturer KUKA AG. In 2019, FANUC acquired Life Robotics Inc., a Japanese startup that develops cobots for small and medium-sized enterprises.
