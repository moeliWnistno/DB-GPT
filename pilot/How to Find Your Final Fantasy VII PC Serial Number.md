Fortunately, there are some ways to recover your serial number or get a replacement one. Here are some tips to help you out:
 
- **Check your email.** If you bought the game online from Square Enix or Steam, you should have received an email confirmation with your serial number. Search your inbox for "Final Fantasy VII" or "Square Enix" and see if you can find it.
- **Contact customer support.** If you can't find your email confirmation or you bought the game from a different retailer, you can try contacting Square Enix or Steam customer support and provide them with your proof of purchase. They may be able to retrieve your serial number or issue you a new one.
- **Use a key generator.** This is a last resort option and not recommended, as it may be illegal or unsafe. A key generator is a software that creates random serial numbers for games or other products. You can find some online by searching for "Final Fantasy VII key generator" or "Final Fantasy VII crack". However, be careful as some of these sites may contain viruses or malware. Also, using a key generator may violate the terms of service of Square Enix or Steam and result in your account being banned.

## Final Fantasy VII Tips and Tricks
 
Final Fantasy VII is a complex and challenging game that requires strategy and skill to master. There are many aspects of the game that may not be obvious or explained well, such as Materia, Limit Breaks, character positioning and more. To help you get the most out of your gaming experience, we have compiled some tips and tricks that will make your journey easier and more enjoyable.
 
### Materia
 
Materia are magical orbs that grant you various abilities, such as magic spells, summons, commands and passive effects. You can equip Materia on your weapons and armor to customize your characters and enhance their stats. However, not all Materia are created equal, and some have drawbacks or hidden effects that you should be aware of. Here are some things to keep in mind when using Materia:

- **Pairing.** Some Materia can be paired with other Materia to create powerful combinations. For example, pairing an Elemental Materia with a Fire Materia on your weapon will make your physical attacks deal fire damage, while pairing them on your armor will reduce fire damage taken. You can also pair a Support Materia with a Magic or Command Materia to modify their effects. For example, pairing an All Materia with a Cure Materia will allow you to heal your entire party with one spell. Experiment with different pairings to find the best ones for your playstyle.
- **Growth.** Materia can level up by gaining AP (Ability Points) from battles. As they level up, they unlock new abilities or improve their existing ones. However, not all weapons and armor have the same growth rate for Materia. Some have normal growth, some have double growth and some have no growth at all. You can check the growth rate of your equipment by pressing the Select button on the menu screen. Try to equip your most important Materia on equipment with high growth rate to level them up faster.
- **Stats.** Materia can affect your stats in positive or negative ways. For example, Magic Materia tend to increase your Magic and MP but decrease your Strength and HP, while Command Materia tend to have no effect on your stats at all. You can check the stat changes of your Materia by pressing the Select button on the menu screen. Try to balance your stats by equipping different types of Materia or using accessories that compensate for the drawbacks.

### Limit Breaks
 
Limit Breaks are powerful attacks that can turn the tide of battle in your favor. Each character has a Limit gauge that fills up when they take damage or deal critical hits. When the gauge is full, they can unleash their Limit Break by selecting it from the menu. Each character has four levels of Limit Breaks, each with two abilities (except for Cait Sith who has only two levels). You can unlock new levels by using your current level's abilities a certain number of times or by killing a certain number of enemies. You can also change your current level by pressing left or right on the menu screen. Here are some things to keep in mind when using Limit Breaks:

- **Timing.** Limit Breaks are most effective when used at the right moment. For example, using Cloud's Braver when the enemy is low on HP will deal more damage than using it at the start of the battle, while using Aeris' Healing Wind when your party is low on HP will heal more than using it when they are full. Try to save your Limit Breaks for when they are most needed or when they can exploit the enemy's weakness.
- **Strategy.** Limit Breaks can also be used strategically to gain an advantage in battle. For example, using Barret's Mindblow will drain the enemy's MP and prevent them from casting spells, while using Tifa's Beat Rush will increase her chances of landing critical hits with her next attacks. Try to use Limit Breaks that complement your character's role or that counter the enemy's strengths.
- **Variety.** Limit Breaks can also be varied depending on the situation or your preference. For example, using Red XIII's Lunatic High will grant your party Haste and increase their speed, while using his Blood Fang will deal damage and heal himself. Try to use different Limit Breaks depending on what you need or what you like.
