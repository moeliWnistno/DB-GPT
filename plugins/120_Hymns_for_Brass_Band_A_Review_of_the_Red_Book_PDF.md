## Abide with Me
 
Abide with Me is one of the most famous and beloved hymns of all time. It was written by Henry Francis Lyte in 1847, shortly before his death from tuberculosis. The hymn expresses a deep sense of trust and comfort in God's presence and grace, especially in times of trouble and darkness. The hymn is based on the words of Jesus in Luke 24:29, "Abide with us: for it is toward evening, and the day is far spent."
 
The arrangement of Abide with Me in the 120 Hymns for Brass Band PDF is simple and elegant. It follows the original melody and harmony of the hymn, with some variations and embellishments. The hymn is in the key of E-flat major, which is a comfortable and warm key for brass instruments. The tempo is marked as Andante, which means moderately slow and graceful. The dynamics range from piano to forte, which means soft to loud. The expression marks include crescendo and diminuendo, which mean gradually increasing and decreasing in volume.
 
Some tips and suggestions for playing Abide with Me with your brass band are:

- Pay attention to the phrasing and breathing of the melody. Try to play each phrase as a complete musical sentence, with a clear beginning and ending. Avoid breaking the phrase in the middle or cutting it short. Breathe at appropriate places, such as at the end of a phrase or at a comma or period.
- Use a warm and rich tone quality for the melody. Avoid playing too harshly or brightly. Use a good amount of air support and control to produce a smooth and even sound. Use vibrato sparingly and tastefully to add some color and expression to the tone.
- Balance the harmony parts with the melody. Avoid playing too loudly or softly compared to the melody. Listen to each other and blend your sounds together. Adjust your intonation and tuning to match the melody and each other.
- Follow the conductor's cues and directions. Watch for changes in tempo, dynamics, articulation, and expression. Anticipate the conductor's gestures and signals and respond accordingly.

By following these tips and suggestions, you can play Abide with Me beautifully and meaningfully with your brass band.
